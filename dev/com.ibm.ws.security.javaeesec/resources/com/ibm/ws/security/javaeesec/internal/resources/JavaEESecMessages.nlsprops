JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_IDENTITYSTORES=CWWKS1910E: IdentityStore object was not found. Make sure that at least one IdentityStore is defined by annotation in the application.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_IDENTITYSTORES.explanation=IdentityStore object was not found. It is required for the authentication and authorization.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_IDENTITYSTORES.useraction=Make sure that the application is properly annotated in order to enable at least one IdentityStore.

JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_VALIDATION=CWWKS1911E: No IdentityStore object supports the user validation. Make sure that at least one IdentityStore supports the user validation.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_VALIDATION.explanation=None of the IdentityStore object supports the user validation, therefore the security code does not authenticate the user.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_VALIDATION.useraction=Make sure that at least one IdentityStore supports the user validation.

JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_HAM=CWWKS1912E: HttpAuthenticationMechanism object cannot be identified for authentication. Make sure that there is one HttpAuthenticationMechanism in the application.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_HAM.explanation=HttpAuthenticationMechanism object cannot be identified for authentication. It could be there is no object, or multiple objects which corresponds the specified condition. Make sure that there is one HttpAuthenticationMechanism in the application.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_HAM.useraction=Make sure that there is one HttpAuthenticationMechanism in the application.

JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_HAM_PROPS=CWWKS1913E: HAMProperties object cannot be identified for authentication. Most likely, there is not any HttpAuthenticationMechanism object in the application. Make sure that one HttpAuthenticationMechanism objct is defined.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_HAM_PROPS.explanation=HAMProperties object cannot be identified for authentication. It could be there is not any HttpAuthenticationMechanism object defined in the application.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_HAM_PROPS.useraction=Make sure that there is one HttpAuthenticationMechanism in the application.

JAVAEESEC_WARNING_NO_REALM_NAME=CWWKS1914W: The realm name for the basic authentication is not set, the value defaultRealm is being used.
JAVAEESEC_WARNING_NO_REALM_NAME.explanation=The realm name for the basic authentication is not set, the default value defaultRealm is being used.
JAVAEESEC_WARNING_NO_REALM_NAME.useraction=If the realm name needs to be set, please set it by using BasicAuthenticationMechanismDefinition annotation in the application.

JAVAEESEC_ERROR_PASSWORDHASH_EXCEPTION=CWWKS1915E: An error was reported while processing the password verification. Make sure that Java runtime is configured properly. The error is {0}.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_PASSWORDHASH_EXCEPTION.explanation=An error was reported while processing the password verification. Most likely, this is due to Java runtime configuration, or Java runtime does not support the specified algorithm.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_PASSWORDHASH_EXCEPTION.useraction=Review the error message for the detailed cause of the error.

JAVAEESEC_ERROR_PASSWORDHASH_INVALID_DATA=CWWKS1916E: The password verification failed because the format of the hashed password data is invalid. Most likely the original password was hashed by using a different algorithm. Make sure that the password was hashed correctly.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_PASSWORDHASH_INVALID_DATA.explanation=The password verification failed because the format of the hashed password data is invalid. Most likely the original password was hashed by using a different algorithm. Make sure that the password was hashed correctly.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_PASSWORDHASH_INVALID_DATA.useraction=Make sure that the password was hashed by the algorithm which this hash verification supports.

JAVAEESEC_ERROR_PASSWORDHASH_INVALID_PARAM=CWWKS1917E: The value {0} of the configuration parameter {1} is invalid. {2} is used instead.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_PASSWORDHASH_INVALID_PARAM.explanation=The value of the configuration parameter is not valid. the value is ignored and the predefined value will be used.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_PASSWORDHASH_INVALID_PARAM.useraction=Make sure that the configuration parameter is set correctly.
